Association events:

- `AssociationEvent-a.jsonld`: assembling
- `AssociationEvent-b.jsonld`: installing
- `AssociationEvent-c.jsonld`: removing
- `AssociationEvent-d.jsonld`: disassembling
- `AssociationEvent-e.jsonld`: assembling two childQuantities (LGTIN) to a parent GRAI
- `AssociationEvent-f.jsonld`: assembling of childEPCs (GIAI) and childQuantities to a parent GRAI. Also involves transfer of `possessing_party` from source to destination, and a sensor reading of `Humidity`
- `AssociationEvent-g.jsonld`: disassembling that's declared erroneous with `reason`: `incorrect_data` and has a `correctiveEventID`
- `AssociationEvent-h.jsonld`: disassembling (correction of the event in the previous example)
