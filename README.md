# EPCIS
Draft files being shared for EPCIS 2.0 development. The repository is organised by work streams, one folder for each work stream (e.g., JSON/JSON-LD, REST bindings, etc.)

The draft EPCIS 2.0 and CBV 2.0 specifications and corresponding artefacts are now in PUBLIC REVIEW at:
https://www.gs1.org/standards/development-work-groups/public-reviews#EPCISCBV_Public-Review-2021

Please use this link to download the .zip (including the public review drafts of the EPCIS / CBV 2.0 standards) and to submit any comments.
Please do not attempt to submit any public review comments as GitHub issues - we need them to be submitted via the official GS1 mechanism so that they can be formally considered by the work group.  

Anyone can submit comments, whether you participate in the GS1 Global Standards Management Process (GSMP) or not - further details at the link above.

Public review for EPCIS/CBV 2.0 ends on 11th November 2021.
