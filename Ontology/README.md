# EPCIS and CBV 2.0 Ontologies and Shape

## Ontologies

- Downloaded from https://ns.mh1.eu/epcis/ and https://ns.mh1.eu/cbv/ (View Source and then save the JSON-LD fragments)
- Converted to Turtle using the same process described in [../Turtle](../Turtle), the sorting in a better way
  - WARNING: `make` overwrites the Turtle files from JSONLD files. 
    If in the future we decide to use Turtle as the master source, this needs to change.

These are draft and subject to change

## RDF Shape

- [EPCIS-SHACL.ttl](EPCIS-SHACL.ttl) is a draft SHACL shape for describing EPCIS events
