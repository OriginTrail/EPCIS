# EPCIS JSON Schemas

The `EPCIS-JSON-Schema.json` schema is generated automatically by the `bundle.sh` script. 
Such a script depends on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) runtime. 
It is included to allow online validators to just work with one file. It contains all the Schemas defined by this specification. 

The `validate.sh` script allows to validate JSON and automatically includes all the individual child schemas.
